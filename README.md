Code for the paper "Enhancing Domain Adaptation through Prompt Gradient Alignment"

Please note that in some parts of the code, we use the term LAPA instead of PGA and LAMPA instead of MPGA. This is because the code was written before the name change, thus the output directory names and some variable names still use the old names.
